# Toxic Language Detector Rules

## Project Structure
- **Backend**: FastAPI application for toxic language detection
- **Model**: LSTM-based model for Vietnamese text classification
- **Extension**: Chrome extension for social media platforms
- **Database**: SQLite database for storing comments and predictions

## Code Style
- Use clear and descriptive variable names
- Add comments in both English and Vietnamese
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Follow standard JavaScript conventions for extension code

## NLP Processing
- Preprocess text with Vietnamese-specific tokenization
- Use appropriate normalization techniques for social media text
- Handle emojis and special characters properly

## API Endpoints
- Use clear path naming
- Include proper validation for all inputs
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Document all endpoints with examples

## Extension Development
- Implement platform-specific comment selectors
- Handle DOM mutations efficiently
- Cache processed comments to avoid duplication
- Use clear visual indicators for toxic comments

## Model Training
- Validate model performance on Vietnamese text
- Consider different token embedding approaches
- Evaluate multi-class classification metrics
- Balance accuracy and performance

## Security
- Implement API key authentication
- Protect against rate limiting and abuse
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Handle sensitive data appropriately

## Testing
- Test API endpoints with sample inputs
- Test extension on supported platforms
- Validate model predictions with test data
- Ensure proper error handling

## Deployment
- Check compatibility with Hugging Face Spaces
- Ensure proper environment variable configuration
- Validate Docker container configuration
- Test integration between components
